## Splashing in the hallways

Back in March, a large hailstorm hit Nashville hard, downing trees on every other street.
This storm was a tipping point for shoddy or poorly maintained construction. During the storm,
part of the roof at Porter East Apartments caved in. The downpour continued into half of the
complex, terrifying residents. After almost a day of emergency calls to management, they
arrived at the scene. Relatively soon after, alternative accomodations were prepared for the residents
whose units were directly exposed to the hole in the roof. Residents living off the same "open-air" hallways were not provided relocation.

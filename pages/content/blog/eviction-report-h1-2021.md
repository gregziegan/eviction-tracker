# Summary

## Red Door Collective

Red Door Collective was created to support and
defend renters through collective action. We
recognize the capitalist commodification of housing
is a tool of oppression and affects poor, working
class, and marginalized communities the hardest.
Our survival depends on fighting shoulder to
shoulder for safe, accessable, and dignified housing.

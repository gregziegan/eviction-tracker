## Summary

### Red Door Collective

Red Door Collective was created to support and defend renters through collective action. We recognize the capitalist commodification of housing is a tool of oppression and affects poor, working class, and marginalized communities the hardest. Our survival depends on fighting shoulder to shoulder for safe, accessible, and dignified housing.

### Nashville, Tennessee

Nashville is located in Davidson County, Tennessee. The city has historically been racially segregated with black communities being disproportionately displaced by "development". There has been an unsustainable amount of growth in the past decade with insufficient investment into affordable housing and renter protections. Property has been snatched up by a small number property owners, particularly following natural disasters.

### Past and Present

Davidson County saw an average of 871 detainer warrants issued per month in 2017, 2018, and 2019.Approximately 67% of the cases in 2019 resulted in an eviction. Between April 2020 and March 2021, 7,904 detainer warrants were issued. Between October and December 2020, at least 42% of closed cases ended in eviction. A few landlords and an even smaller number of attorneys are responsible for the majority of eviction cases in Davidson Co.

### Future of Housing

These issues will get worse before they get better. We at Red Door Collective understand the need forc omprehensive rent relief, new affordable housing, and additional protections for renters.

## Background

## Evictions in Nashville

In Davidson Co., renters can be evicted for any violation of their lease, including non-payment of rent. Landlords are required to provide written notice of potential eviction with 14 days to correct the issue for late payment of rent (T.C.A.Section 66-28-505). It is important to know tenants can sign away protections if such language is included in their signed lease. A writ of restitution is issued if possession is awarded to the plaintiff.

### Demographics

Approximately 700,000 live in Davidson Co. as of 2019. Twenty-seven percent are Black/African American and 10% are Hispanic/Latinx. Between 2015 and 2019, the average gross rent was $1,102 and the average per capita income was $36,440. Only 54.3% of housing units were occupied by their owner in 2019 in Davidson Co.

### Housing shortage, segregation

There is a long history of racists and classist policies driving racial segregation of housing in Nashville. Laws such as the Slum Clearance and Urban Redevelopment Act (1945) and Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 contributed to the destruction of predominantly black neighborhoods. Gentrification continues in Nashville today, with no evidence that such destruction positively affects the residents (Hightower & Fraser, 2020) as proponents claim. In recent years, the cost of living in Nashville has skyrocketed with few options for low-income residents and families (Gibbs, 2021) who struggle to stay in their homes or find new ones.

## Disaster(s) strike

### Let's back up...

Immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Davidson Co. was hit by a deadly tornado on the night of March 2 and into the morning of March 3, 2020 (Loller & Kruesi, 2020). Similarly to after the catastrophic flooding in 2010, many homeowners were suddenly bombarded by offers to buy their now damaged homes. Increased gentrification has been significant in historically neglected and oppressed areas of Nashville impacted by severe weather events and has resulted in further displacement of such communities.

### Affects of COVID-19

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,there have been many changes to court rules and procedures. In Davidson County, outside witnesses were not allowed in mid-2020, number of cases were limited in late 2020, and court was shut down in December 2020 and reopened in March 2021.

### Diversionary court

After the COVID-19 pandemic, Judge Rachel Bell founded the LEGACY diversionary court (Timms, 2021). Thegoal of this court is to mediate eviction proceedings between tenants and landlords, help connect tenants to resources such as monetary rental assistance, and prevent evictions.

### Case backlog and illegal evictions

While eviction hearings were delayed by COVID restrictions and the CDC eviction moratorium, nearly 2,000 cases were yet to be heard in Spring 2021 (Finley, 2021). Community advocates noted that many residents were being scared out of their residences illegally by landlords and property managers.

## Eviction Data, 2017-2019

Between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019, over 31,000 detainer warrants were filed. The number filed per year increased 20% over the three-year period, with approximately 9,358 detainer warrants filed in 2017, 10,543 in 2018, and 11,471 in 2019. While the population of Davidson Co. increased in this time frame, the rate of detainer warrants filed per year also increased from 14.2 detainer warrants issued per 10,000 persons in 2017 to 16.8 in 2019.

A few plaintiffs represent a large number of detainer warrants in Nashville (Figure 2). Because plaintiff names change and are inconsistently listed on detainer warrants, the number of cases shown are an approximation. During this time period, Metropolitan Developmentand Housing Agency (MDHA) submitted 6,081 detainer warrants (not shown in Figure 2). MDHA alone account for approximately 1 of every 6 detainer warrants between 2017 and 2019.

## Plaintiff attorneys and judgements, 2017-2019

A consistent group of eviction attorneys are responsible forrepresenting the majority (74.1% in 2019) of eviction cases in Davidson Co., Tennessee (Table 1). The five most common attorneys are consistent between years and account for a growing percent of all detainer warrants filed.

To determine frequency of judgment outcomes, we randomly sampled of 5% (574) of detainer warrants in 2019 and manually entered judgement information. While the below data does not include all cases, we believe it can provide insight into most common outcomes in previous years.

Figure 3 shows that over half of cases sampled resulted inrepossession of property. Over 1 in 5 resulted in a non-suit. The category "non-suit" isused when cases are settled outside of court and could mean any outcome for the tenant. Cases with "other" judgements typically did not have a judgement listed despite being closed. For the 221 cases with monetary damages, approximately $750,000 was awarded to landlords or an average of $3,434 per case. The median financial award was $2,443.

## Eviction Data 2020-2021

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the total number of detainer warrants (DWs) issued in Davidson County as well as the most frequent landlords seeking to evict people. Prior to COVID-19, approximately 900 and 1,200 DWs were issued every month. The number of DWs per month sharply declined to 122 cases in April 2020. but has rebounded slightly (Figure X). The most common plaintiffs listed on DWs between April 2020 and March 2021 include the Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency (MDHA), Elmington Propoerty Management, and Hickory Highlands Apartments (FigureX). MDHA decreased their overall share of evictions since COVID-19, but are still the most frequently listed plaintiff during this period. If the number of detainer warrants issued in Davidson Co. (see Page 6) continued to grow in the absence of COVID, we could have expected approximately 12,650 detainer warrants issued in 2020 or 1,054 per month.

## Top 10 Plaintiffs and Attorneys

## Number of Defendants and case judgements, 2020-2021

On average, for every five detainer warrants submitted between October 2020 and March 2021, at least six people are listed as defendants. We know that this number largely underestimates the total number of people at risk of being evicted; detainer warrants arenot required to list all defendants, including children living inside the home.

FIGURE 6. NUMBER OF DETAINERWARRANTS AND NAMEDDEFENDANTS BY MONTH,OCTOBER TO DECEMBER 2020,DAVIDSON CO. TENNESSEENUMBER OF DEFENDANTS ANDCASE JUDGEMENTS, 2020-2021

We began collecting judgements consistently in October 2020. Approximately 1711 detainer warrants were filed between October 1 and December 31, 2020. By April 21, 2021 988 of those cases were closed. Figure 7 shows that the majority of judgements were "non-suits" while over a 40% resulted in repossession of property by the landlord. Only 22% of the cases we sampled from 2019 resulted in a non-suit judgement (Figure 3). We have noted that in the time since these data were collected, some landlords have returned to court to seek monetary damages after winning possession. Due to these additional judgements and illegal evictions occurring outside of the legal process, we know the rateof eviction following a detainer warrant is much higher than documented. The vast majority of cases were decided in favor of the plaintiff by default or absence of thedefendant in court. Only 4.7% of cases ended in dismissal. Of the 141 cases that noted both possession and financial damages, over $877,000 was awarded to landlords or an average of $6,177. The median financial award was $5,386.

## Mapping Detainer Warrants and Evictions, 2017-2021

FIGURE 8. RATE OF DETAINERWARRANTS ISSUED PER MONTHBY ZIP CODE, JANUARY 2017 TO DECEMBER 2019, DAVIDSON CO.TENNESSEE

FIGURE 9. RATE OF DETAINERWARRANTS ISSUED PER MONTH BYZIP CODE, JANUARY 2020 TO MARCH 2021, DAVIDSON CO.TENNESSEE

The number of cases filed monthly differed by ZIP code across time periods. To account for population differences between ZIP codes, we calculated rates with 2019 population estimates. The monthly rates were split into four equal groups called "quartiles" tocompare highest and lowest rates of detainer warrants (DWs) issued across Davidson Co. Because ZIP codes cross county lines, rates for some ZIP codes (i.e. 37027, 37135) are likely underestimated. Rates are calculated per 10,000 persons.

Overall, the ZIP codes with the highest and lowest rates did not change between 2019-2017 (Figure 8) and 2020-2021 (Figure 9) data. As a whole, there are higher rates ofdetainer warrants issued in the eastern half of Davidson Co. in neighborhoods such as North Nashville, South Nashville, Antioch, Madison, and Donelson. Neighborhoods inthe western half of Davidson Co. such as Belle Meade, Bellevue, and Joelton tended to have lower rates of detainer warrants issued. It is worth noting that the range rates of detainer warrants issued monthly was smaller in 2020-2021 compared to 2017-2019.

## Conclusion

### Housing Crisis Looming

This document was put together in the Spring and Summer 2021, in themonths when the CDC Moratorium was set to expire and then pushed backtemporarily, when hundreds of families waited months to hear about rentrelief in Davidson Co. after struggling through bureaucratic barriers, andwhen the COVID-19 pandemic continued to threaten the lives of the most vulnerable. In recent months numerous community groups have fought to stop slumlords from abusing renters across Nashville, including at Mosaic Apartments, WC Mobile Home Community, The Blue Note Apartments, and Porter East Apartments. To say this report will come out at acrossroads in housing is an understatement. What happens in the next few months is up to us. How many more families will be forced out of their homes, unable to find safe or affordable shelter? How many more people who sustain Nashville will no longer be able to live here? What are we willing to do for our freedom?

Detainer warrant filings have increased since 2017 and are now backlogged as we wait for many of the thousands of cases filed during the COVID-19 pandemic to be settled. Evictions have disproportionately affected the undeserved areas of Nashville while housing costs have skyrocketed in the midst of rapid gentrification. These are desperate times that require colletive action on a massive scale. The first step of rectifying these abuses is to expose them to the light. We hope that this report increases awareness,agency, and agitation towards action. A better world is possible, Nashville.

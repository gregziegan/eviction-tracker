NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT(S) 

Failure to appear and answer this Summons will result in judgment by default being rendered against you for the 
relief  requested.  Tennessee  law  provides  a  ten  thousand  dollar  ($10,000)  personal  property  exemption  from 
execution or seizure to satisfy a judgment. If a judgment should be entered against you in this action and you 
wish  to  claim  property  as  exempt,  you  must  file  a  written  list,  under  oath,  of  the  items  you  wish  to  claim  as 
exempt with the clerk of the court. This list may be filed at any time and may be changed by you thereafter as 
necessary;  however,  unless  it  is  filed  before  the  judgment  becomes  final,  it  will  not  be  effective  as  to  any 
execution or garnishment issued prior to the filing of the list. Certain items are automatically exempt by law and 
do not need to be listed; these items include items of necessary wearing apparel (clothing) for yourself and your 
family and trunks and other receptacles necessary to contain such apparel, family portraits, the family Bible, and 
school  books.  Should  any  of  these  items  be  seized,  you  would  have  the  right  to  recover  them.  If  you  do  not 
understand your exemption right or how to execute it, you may wish to seek the counsel of a lawyer.

# Eviction Tracker

Currently helping verify detainer warrant data for middle Tennessee - via Middle TN DSA - Red Door Collective

## Phone Number Verification

1. Download the Google Sheet - GitHub actions? Python?
2. Save the difference to the repository - Python? Bash?
3. Go and verify _changes to_ phone numbers - Python?
4. Save the verified information (contact name, carrier?, whatever we care about to the repo) Python?
5. Take the verification info and put it into the sheet somehow - Python?
6. re-upload the sheet (figure out if it should be a separate sheet or replace operation?)
7. re-run on a schedule

## Development

### Setup

#### Nix

Nix is a tool we use to ensure reproducable builds and deployments. Python's default build and deployment system is notoriously tricky.
We've elected to use Nix instead to ease setup. Nix can be used for installing and deploying multiple languages, which may end up being useful for this project.

##### Install Nix

Please follow the instructions to install [Nix on their website](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install).

(Please ignore instructions regarding **NixOS** - that's a whole new operating system).

##### Using Nix

To work with the same python version as everyone else working on this project, you'll need to make sure you're in the `nix-shell` first.

1. Check that you're in the same directory as `shell.nix`
2. Type `nix-shell` and hit enter
3. Wait for necessary dependencies to install from the internet to your machine

You'll get a new prompt that looks like:

```
[nix-shell:~/some/path/eviction-tracker]$ 
```

Now you're ready to run `python` and `ipython`! You can escape the `nix-shell` at any time by holding ctrl pressing the D key or typing `exit` and pressing enter.

#### Google Spreadsheets

You'll need authentication to make requests to the online spreadsheet with the most current data.

Please install [Keybase](https://keybase.io/), a secure messaging platform. I will send any contributor who requests the authentication secrets the necessary file. When I send the file over Keybase, you'll need to download it, and move it somewhere you won't lose it.

By default, our scripts expect the file to be at the following path: `~/.config/gspread/service_account.json`. In plain english: it should be in your home directory, under a hidden folder named `.config` and finally inside another folder called `gspread`. The file should be named `service_account.json`. If these are all true, you're good to go! If you'd like to save the file elsewhere or rename it, just run the script with your custom path under the optional argument: `--service_account_key=/path/to/your/file.json`.

### Using a REPL

REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) is a concept implemented in many programming languages. If you've never written python before, we recommend spending an afternoon on [these basics](https://developers.google.com/edu/python). You'll interact with a REPL in those courses. 

While in a [Nix Shell](#using-nix), launch the IPython shell like so:

```
ipython
```

And now, you can write python code with any of our libraries!

### Running commands

While in a [Nix Shell](#using-nix), run `flask <name-of-command>`.

#### Sync database

To sync the data from our org's Google Spreadsheet, run `flask sync <spreadsheet-name>`.

If you want just a bit of data to work with locally, pass the `--limit` argument.

Example: `flask sync --sheet-name 'detainer-warrants_15-02-2020' --limit 10` will populate the database with 10 detainer warrants from the spreadsheet titled `detainer-warrants_15-02-2020`.

#### Run app

To run the website locally, use `flask run --no-reload` within the `nix-shell`.
